# Project Nexus: Backend Engineering Documentation

## Overview
Project Nexus is a capstone initiative under the ALX ProDev Backend Engineering program. This repository documents key backend engineering concepts, tools, best practices, and challenges faced during the learning journey.

## 🚀 Key Technologies Covered
- **Python** – Core programming language used throughout the program.
- **Django** – Web framework for building scalable backend systems.
- **Django REST Framework (DRF)** – Toolkit for building RESTful APIs.
- **GraphQL** – Efficient query-based API alternative.
- **PostgreSQL** – Relational database used in most projects.
- **Docker** – For containerization and consistent dev environments.
- **Celery + RabbitMQ** – Background task management and message queues.
- **CI/CD** – GitHub Actions for automated testing & deployment.

## 🧠 Core Backend Concepts
- **Database Design** – Normalization, indexing, relational modeling.
- **RESTful API Design** – CRUD operations, serialization, versioning.
- **GraphQL APIs** – Query flexibility and nested data resolution.
- **Authentication & Authorization** – Token-based auth, permissions.
- **Asynchronous Processing** – Celery for email, report generation.
- **Caching Strategies** – Redis caching to optimize performance.
- **Containerization** – Using Docker to isolate and deploy services.
- **CI/CD Pipelines** – GitHub Actions for quality assurance.

## 🧩 Challenges & Solutions
| Challenge | Solution |
|----------|----------|
| Docker not recognizing dependencies | Used multi-stage Docker builds and volume mapping |
| Complex query optimization | Used `select_related`, `prefetch_related`, and raw SQL |
| Background tasks not executing | Corrected Celery broker setup and worker config |
| Broken deployments in CI | Debugged GitHub Actions YAML, used `secrets` for env vars |

## ✅ Best Practices & Takeaways
- Write **modular, reusable code** — follow DRY principles.
- Use **environment variables** for secrets and configs.
- Always test APIs with **Postman** and **unit tests**.
- Document APIs using **Swagger/OpenAPI** early.
- Set up **Docker** and **CI/CD** from the beginning, not later.
- Log regularly and handle exceptions gracefully.
- Collaborate continuously using **Git**, **Notion**, and **Discord**.

## 💬 Collaboration & Teamwork
We engaged in weekly standups and collaborated with frontend learners using Discord. Backend APIs were designed early to allow frontend teams to integrate smoothly using Swagger documentation and mock endpoints.
